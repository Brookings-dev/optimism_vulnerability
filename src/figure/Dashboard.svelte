			Fake news, conspiracy theories, the shuttering of local newspapers, rumors of bizarre side
			effects from COVID vaccinations, and the erosion of basic trust in scientific facts
			increasingly distort our public debates. Experts have pointed to many root causes of these
			developments. These range from harmful social media business models to educational disparities
			to cynical political actors and more. While all these factors contribute in some ways to the
			country’s disinformation crisis, policymakers and civil society leaders lack a tool that can
			pinpoint where and how in the country individuals are most at risk. <span id="more"
				>Recently, emerging neurological research has shown clear links between despair and
				vulnerability to misinformation, right-wing radicalization, and violence. Building on her
				nationwide vulnerability indicator, The Geography of Hope and Desperation, which maps trends
				in hope and wellbeing with trends in deaths of despair (premature deaths due to drug
				overdose, alcohol poisoning, and suicide), Brookings Senior Fellow Carol Graham and her
				colleague Emily Dobson at the University of Maryland, in collaboration with the Brookings
				Communications team, have built a parallel tool which demonstrates the links – and
				intermediating channels – between despair and misinformation at the level of populations and
				places. The first vulnerability indicator already provided some evidence: during the height
				of the COVID-19 pandemic, regions with the highest levels of despair also had the highest
				rates of preventable COVID deaths—which often occur among the unvaccinated. The new
				interactive allows users to explore the links between despair and misinformation1 with a
				focus on key channels: lack of access to credible local news and to health information; lack
				of access to opportunities for education beyond the high school level; low levels of
				cognitive skills among high school graduates; and key socio-economic indicators such as
				poverty and unemployment rates. The interactive allows for viewing these inter-related
				factors at both state and county levels across the countries. The tool will provide
				policymakers, academics, journalists, and public health professionals with insights into the
				interactions among key variables which lead to disinformation, a first step towards
				combatting the problem.</span
