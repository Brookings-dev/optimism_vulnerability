		Fake news, conspiracy theories, the shuttering of local newspapers, rumors of bizarre side
		effects from COVID vaccinations, and the erosion of basic trust in scientific facts increasingly
		distort our public debates. Experts have pointed to many root causes of these developments.
		These range from harmful social media business models to educational disparities to cynical
		political actors and more. While all these factors contribute in some ways to the country’s
		disinformation crisis, policymakers and civil society leaders lack a tool that can pinpoint
		where and how in the country individuals are most at risk. <span id="more"
			>Recently, emerging neurological research has shown clear links between despair and
			vulnerability to misinformation, right-wing radicalization, and violence. Building on her
			nationwide vulnerability indicator, The Geography of Hope and Desperation, which maps trends
			in hope and wellbeing with trends in deaths of despair (premature deaths due to drug overdose,
			alcohol poisoning, and suicide), Brookings Senior Fellow Carol Graham and her colleague Emily
			Dobson at the University of Maryland, in collaboration with the Brookings Communications team,
			have built a parallel tool which demonstrates the links – and intermediating channels –
			between despair and misinformation at the level of populations and places. The first
			vulnerability indicator already provided some evidence: during the height of the COVID-19
			pandemic, regions with the highest levels of despair also had the highest rates of preventable
			COVID deaths—which often occur among the unvaccinated. The new interactive allows users to
			explore the links between despair and misinformation1 with a focus on key channels: lack of
			access to credible local news and to health information; lack of access to opportunities for
			education beyond the high school level; low levels of cognitive skills among high school
			graduates; and key socio-economic indicators such as poverty and unemployment rates. The
			interactive allows for viewing these inter-related factors at both state and county levels
			across the countries. The tool will provide policymakers, academics, journalists, and public
			health professionals with insights into the interactions among key variables which lead to
			disinformation, a first step towards combatting the problem.</span
